## Description
This is an application to prepare weekly menu plans. It allows you to create manually menu plans from zero, or to generate automatically a full weekly menu plan.

## Screenshots
Screenshots here, please.

## Installation
This is a Java Maven project. Clone this repository and import it with Eclipse or Spring Tool Suite.

## Running
 First, check the application-{environment}.properties files. Then, launch it with Run As/Sprint Boot App.

## Roadmap
The application will evolve until suggestions are over. One feature I want to implement is to print the menu plans and the recipes.
